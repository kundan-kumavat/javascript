- A new object is created
- A prototype is linked: The newly created object gets linked to the prototype property of the constructor function. This means that it has acess to properties and methods defined on hte constructor's function
-The constructor is called: The constructor function is called with specifed arugments and this bound to
the newly created object. If no explicit return value is specified from the contrustor, javascript
assumes thi, the newly created object, to be the intended return value
- The new object is returned: After the constructor function has been called, if it doesn't return a non-primitive value(object, array, fuction), the newly created object is returned
